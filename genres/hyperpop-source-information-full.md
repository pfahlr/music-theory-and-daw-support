# Hyperpop

- BPM: 140-200 (most common), 80-205 (extended range)

Hyperpop often makes use of Autotune and other extreme/novel uses of effects and dischordant sounds.

Hyperpop artists generally prioritize chaotic and experimental rhythmic complexity rather than 
strict adherence to complex time signatures. Though odd meters like 5/4 or 7/8 may appear, 
the rhythmic unpredictability more often comes from rapid shifts in tempo, the layering of 
conflicting rhythms (polyrhythms), and glitchy, asymmetrical percussion patterns.

## Melody / Theme

Hyperpop melodies often use distorted and pitch-shifted vocal chops and synthesized, often bright, 
instrument sounds, heavily layered with reverb, delay, and other effects to create an extreme and
maximalist sound. Melodies are frequently characterized by catchy, repetitive patterns using arpeggios,
and can incorporate major or minor scales, often with the use of chords and their extensions like 9ths 
for added complexity and texture.

**common features**:  Phrygian, Lydian, and Mixolydian scales... Bouncy Staccato, Artificial Sounds, 
Exaggerated Effects, Vocal Chops, Catchy and Repetitive, Maximalist Approach, Arpeggios, Counter Melodies

## Harmony 
Hyperpop incorporates harmony through layered, pitch-corrected vocals, often using harmonies that are doubled, 
shifted up or down, or pitched-shifted to create unique textures and movement within the song. Rather than 
conventional chords, much of the harmonic content is delivered by the melodies and vocal lines, with prominent 
synth leads, and layered or chopped vocals that create a dense, experimental soundscape Melody-Driven Harmony: 
Harmony is often implied by the vocal lines and synth melodies rather than traditional chord structures. 
**common features**:  Major/Minor, Dorian, Mixolydian, Pentatonic, Lydian Modes... Layered Vocals, 
Pitch-Shift and Automated Pitch and Formants, Synth Leads,  Implying Chords, , Dynamic EQ


## Chord Progressions / Common Hyperpop Chord Structures
Hyperpop chord progressions often feature borrowed chords, seventh chords, and minor-to-major 
transitions using scales like Lydian to achieve a bright, emotional sound.  Common progressions include the
minor 1, major 7, major 6 (1-7-6) or I-V-vi-IV, with melodic elements like fillers and extensions adding color 
and complexity, as seen in the use of seventh chords and minor chords with extended or relative minor harmonies. 

- Borrowed Chords: These are chords from a parallel key, often used to add a "borrowed" or darker quality to the
  progression, such as a minor-like feel to a major progression. 
- Seventh Chords: Adding a seventh note to a chord, like a minor 7th or major 7th, creates added color 
  and complexity. For example, 
  a I-IV-V-I progression can become I-IV-V7-I to make it sound more electronic and polished. 
- Minor-to-Major Transitions: These transitions provide an emotional shift, like moving from a stable 
  minor chord to a more uplifting major chord. 

### Examples of Common Progressions
- 1-7-6 (minor 1, major 7, major 6): A very popular and common progression in hyperpop, providing a distinct, 
  emotional sound. 
- I-V-vi-IV (1-5-6-4): A widely recognized progression in pop music, but used in hyperpop to create ear-worms 
  and familiar harmonic foundations. 
- Ascending Progressions: Progressions that move upward, such as A minor to C to D, are effective for creating 
  a sense of tension and forward momentum. 

### Tips for Hyperpop Chord Progressions
- Use the Lydian Mode: The bright, triumphant sound of the Lydian mode can be used to add a happy or 
  triumphant quality to hyperpop songs. 
- Add Melodic Extensions: Chord extensions and filler notes add depth and color, contributing to the 
  genre's signature sound. 
- Incorporate Borrowed Chords and Relative Minor Chords: These chords offer opportunities to create 
  new melodic pathways and transitions within a key.
