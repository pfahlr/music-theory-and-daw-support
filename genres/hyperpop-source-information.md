# Hyperpop — Studio One-Pager

**BPM:** 140–200 (common), 80–205 (extended)  
**Meters:** Mostly 4/4; playful switches; syncopation, polyrhythms, glitch.

**Modes:** Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian; also Major/Minor, Dorian; pentatonic colors.

## Rhythm
Chaotic/experimental complexity; rapid tempo shifts; layered/conflicting rhythms; glitchy asymmetry.

## Melody
Bright synth leads & vocal chops; heavy autotune/formant/pitch FX; catchy repetitive arps; maximalist layering; counter-melodies.

## Harmony
Melody-driven; layered pitched vocals imply harmony; frequent borrowed chords; 7ths/9ths for sheen; minor↔major pivots.

## Common Progressions
- i–VII–VI
- I–V–vi–IV
- Ascending motion (e.g., i→III→IV)
- Add 7ths/9ths for color

## Voicings & Production
- **Drums:** transient-forward, staccato/glitch fills, sidechain pump  
- **Bass:** mono/detuned saw; octave jumps; distortion; slides  
- **Pads:** wide, bright (Lydian), shimmer; slow attack or gate-chop  
- **Leads/Vox:** hard-tuned, 3rds/6ths layers; wide detune; OTT/bitcrush

## Degree Focus (Melody)
Lean on 1, 2, #4(=II), 5, **bVII**; spice with **bVI/bII**.

## Extensions
9ths common; 11ths/13ths for extreme brightness.

## Tips
- Use Lydian’s #4 for lift  
- Borrow bVII/bVI/bII for contrast  
- Automate formants/pitch; chop vocals for motifs
